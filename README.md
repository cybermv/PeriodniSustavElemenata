# Periodni sustav elemenata

This project is my first thing I made with Windows Forms and C#. The story goes like this - I found on the internet that you can order some CD-s with free software. Being a kid and seeing "FREE" on the internet was cool at that time so I ordered everything I could. Of course, I didn't know what programs will I get, but one program was great - Visual Studio 2015.

I clicked around and found out I could build windows by dragging controls around. At that time Paint was the best computer game
I knew so this was an amazing improvement. I even showed this "game" to a few friends, but it was boring because nothing actually worked. Then I got bored and forgot about it.

A few months later I started learning QBASIC in school. All of a sudden, a moment of clarity! The same way I can write a program that runs in a console I could give some behaviour to various events of a control, like showing message boxes, adding up numbers etc. So I started copying some C# from the internet and those controls weren't boring anymore.

I don't really remember why I decided to make the periodic table as my first project but it stuck and I was quite proud with the result. So I showed it to my teacher in school and he sent me to the national competition in informatics to present my work, and things went better than expected. Got a prize, started loving programming, and here I am now.

I'm not quite sure why I put this project online - it isn't a project you can show off, it isn't an indicator of my current knowledge (yes, I'm aware that databases exist now :)) nor is it very interesting. But it helps me remember how I was (and still am) curious by nature and that everyone's beginnings are very humble. But they can be a start of something great...


Anyway, don't read the code :P I don't hardcode things nowadays in such great measure!
